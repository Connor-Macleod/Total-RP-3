## New features

* **New companion browser**. You can now easily bind a companion profile to a companion by using the Bind button. The new companion browser will show you all your customizable companions. **Please note that battle-pets have to be renamed in order to be customizable. Mount customization is coming.**
* New anchoring option for the tooltip. You can choose to display Total RP 3's tooltip on your cursor.

## Bug fixes

* Fixed an issue with the data broker module that was hiding the cloak at each interface load. _Thanks to [Elennoko] and [Arakara] for reporting this issue._
* Fixed an issue where information transfers were not correctly initialized between two Total RP 3 users on mouseover.
