## Insert full RP name in the chat frame

When shift-clicking someone's name in the chat frame, Total RP 3 will now insert that person's full RP name as shown in the chat frame. We also added a new option in the chat settings for how names are displayed to show titles next to people's names.

## Other improvements

* Added short title value in our Mary Sue Protocol implementation so it can be filtered out by other add-ons (stored in the `PX` for prefix).

## Bug fixes

* Fixed a rare issue in the register list.
* Added missing eye color value in our Mary Sue Protocol implementation.
