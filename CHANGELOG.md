## The Total RP 3 world map button is back

After trying to put our scanning options in the world map filters dropdown (as it made a lot of sense for them to be there), we found out it was causing so many issues that it wasn't worth it. We have restored our Total RP 3 world map button to access the scanning options (quick reminder that you can move it around in the settings).

## Bug fixes

- Fixed a Lua error when trying to get class color and there is no english class available ([ticket #78](https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/total-rp-3/issues/78)).
- Fixed a Lua error for unknown profiles when the mature filter is enabled ([ticket #76](https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/total-rp-3/issues/76)).
- Fixed a taint issue causing a message about an action blocked to be displayed in the chat frame when opening the world map during combat, by restoring the good old world map button. ([ticket #58](https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/total-rp-3/issues/58)).
- Fixed a taint issue preventing from queuing for battlegrounds by switching to a dedicated dropdown library ([ticket #59](https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/total-rp-3/issues/59)).
- Fixed an issue where the world map button anchoring position setting was not saved.
- Fixed the anchoring of the world map button so it is nicely placed in a good spot in all four corners.

## Other improvements

- Added cooldown effect on the world map button while scanning.
