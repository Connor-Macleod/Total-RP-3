# Change-log 1.1.0

## New communication system

This version brings a new communication system needed for TRP Extended and Legion. This communication system is not compatible with previous TRP3 versions. **So don't panic if you don't receive any profile from previous version.**

But that also means that people should prepare to update when this version comes live. If they stay with an older version they will be isolated from the rest of the TRP community.

## Improvements

* **Added an option to hide custom RP tooltips when you are out of character,** available in the tooltips settings, disabled by default.
* **Added an option to disable custom colors in the tooltips,** available in the tooltips settings.
* **Added an option to increase the color contrast for the text in the tooltips,** in the tooltips settings. Enable this option to allow Total RP 3 to modify the custom colors to make the text more readable if the color is too dark.
* **Added a slash command to reload the add-on with empty data.**
* **Various bug fixes.**
* **Preparing the add-on for Legion release.** This implies a new communication system.
