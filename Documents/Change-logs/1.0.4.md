# Change-log 1.0.4

## Improvements

* **Added an option to hide custom RP tooltips when you are out of character**, available in the tooltips settings, disabled by default.
* **Added an option to disable custom colors in the tooltips**, available in the tooltips settings.
* **Added an option to increase the color contrast for the text in the tooltips**, in the tooltips settings. Enable this option to allow Total RP 3 to modify the custom colors to make the text more readable if the color is too dark.
* **Added a slash command to reload the add-on with empty data**, for testing and debugging purposes. If you run into an issue, try running the `/trp3 stash` command to stash away your data (profiles, settings, companions) and reload the add-on with empty settings and see if you still have an issue. Running the `/trp3 stash` command a second time will restore your data back.
