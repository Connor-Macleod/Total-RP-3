# Change-log 1.1.0

## New communication system

This version brings a new communication system needed for TRP3: Extended and Legion. This communication system is not compatible with previous TRP3 versions. **So don't panic if you don't receive any profile from previous version.**

But that also means that people should prepare to update when this version comes live. If they stay with an older version they will be isolated from the rest of the TRP community.

## Improvements

We have added a bunch of new options to the tooltips settings (all of them are off by default, you will have to turn them on (like those Goldshire campers do, if you know what I meanâ€¦)).

You can now:
* Hide custom RP tooltips when you are out of character.
* Disable custom colors in the tooltips, if you find them distracting.
* Dynamically increase the color contrast ratio for the text in the tooltips. Enable this option to allow Total RP 3 to modify the custom colors defined by other players to make the text more readable if the color is too dark.

Other improvements
* Added a slash command to reload the add-on with empty data.
* Various bug fixes.

## Removed features

We had to remove the toolbar buttons for showing and hiding your helmet and your cloak as Blizzard removed this feature in Legion. The API functions used by Total RP 3 are no longer present in the game, you will now have to go to a transmog NPC to hide your helmet or your cloak.
